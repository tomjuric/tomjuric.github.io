      <p>
Hi there! Welcome to Tom's simple home on the Internet.
Ah, the Internet. Did you know that it transfers five petabytes of data every minute? All those memes, cat videos and Spotify music... Some say that the way it works is magical -- but it really isn't.
It's talent and sweat. I am part of the team that ensures that all those packets of data get delivered to you, unsniffed. We make sure that one bad config on key components doesn't bork one part of that  Internet traffic. We make the system run. In short, I work in Operations Command Center as Linux Admin. Overall - high energy, versatile, team oriented, hard-working individual.
      </p>
      <p>
In free time, I enjoy reading books, various articles and financial statements and I'm working out. I'm interested in various fields, mostly the tech, finance and pharmaceuticals -- about which I try to learn new things every day. I like to play chess and tennis as well.

      <p>Contact info is down below. I highly value my time, so please make it worth it. Be direct and concise :)</p>
