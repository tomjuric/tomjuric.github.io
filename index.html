        About
      </p>
      <p>
Hi there! Welcome to Tom's simple home on the Internet.
Ah, the Internet. Did you know that it transfers almost seven petabytes of data every minute? All those memes, cat videos and Spotify music... Some say that the way it works is magical -- but it really isn't.
It's talent and sweat. I am part of the team that ensures that all those packets of data get delivered to you. We make sure that one bad config on key components doesn't break one part of that  Internet traffic. We make the system run.
      </p>
      <p>
In short, I work as Linux Admin in Operations Command Center of one premium web hosting company. Overall - high energy, versatile, team oriented, hard-working individual.
      </p>
      <p>
In free time, I enjoy reading books, various articles and financial statements and I'm working out. I'm interested in several fields, mostly tech, finance and pharmaceuticals -- about which I try to learn new things every day. I like to play chess and tennis as well. 
      </p>

Contact info and Goodreads profile (to see what I'm currently reading, if you are interested) are down below (best way to contact me is via email). All I have in this world is time, so please make it worth it. Be direct and concise :)
